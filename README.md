# Mental Health Sidekick

Mental Health Sidekick allow for easy and convenient tracking of
your daily mood and mental health symptoms. Other mental health tracking apps often have
cluttered or messy interfaces. For those with ADHD or other neuro-divergences, that can make it *much* harder
to use of an application.

Mental Health Sidekick provides a clean user interface and text message reminders to help you track your day.

The application is currently in ***closed beta***. Please check back later (or STAR & watch this repo) to receive
future updates on the status of Mental Health Sidekick. Thank you so much for your interest in this project!!
